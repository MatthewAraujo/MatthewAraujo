# 👋 Hey, I'm Matthew! 

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate software developer who loves diving into backend challenges, building efficient fullstack apps, and experimenting with new technologies. Whether it's coding in **Go**, **Node.js**, or designing intuitive UIs with **Next.js** and **React**, I'm always exploring ways to push the boundaries of software development.

## 👨‍💻 About Me
- 💼 Currently focused on **file exploration systems** in **Go** and enhancing performance through **Redis caching**.
- 🎓 Teaching assistant for programming courses at university, helping students master **JavaScript**, **C**, and **data structures**.
- 🚀 I've worked on real-world projects with **Google Cloud Partners**, creating efficient systems using **Go**, **Node.js**, and architecting frontend solutions with **React**.
- 🔧 I love automating tasks, building tools like my **update-golang** script, and creating intuitive APIs for various use cases.
- 🏆 Winner of **CanSat Hackathon** and proud creator of **Notify**, a tool built in **Golang** for sending real-time GitHub repo notifications.

## 🔭 Current Focus
- **Golang & Redis** – diving into caching strategies and improving system performance with **Go**.
- **File exploration systems** – building a seamless file browser with **Go** and **HTMX**.
- **Fullstack development** – creating dynamic and responsive applications with **Next.js** and **React**, aiming for great user experiences and high performance.

## 💡 Fun Projects
- **update-golang** – A tool to automatically update Go versions in your projects.
- **Notify** – Get real-time email alerts when your GitHub repositories change (written in Golang).
- **IMDB for Music** – A side project using the **Spotify API** to rank and list music based on various metrics.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools I Love
- **Backend**: Go, Node.js, Python
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, HTMX, Templ
- **Databases**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Google Cloud SQL
- **Cloud & DevOps**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Docker, CI/CD pipelines
- **Other tools**: Prisma, N8N, Redis, Metasploit (security is always a focus!)
