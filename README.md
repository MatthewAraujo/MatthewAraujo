# Hey there! 👋 I'm Matthew

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a developer with a twist of humor and a sprinkle of creativity. Let's dive into the world of code, laughs, and some quirky facts about me.

## Who Am I? 🤔

I'm Matthew, a software developer with 2 years of experience. I've dabbled in a bit of everything from front-end magic to back-end sorcery, and even some data science wizardry. Currently, I'm an IT assistant and almost done with my degree. I'm on a quest to level up from a junior developer to a near-pleno (that's "almost-senior" for those not in the know).

### The Skills that Pay the Bills 🛠️

- **Front-end:** React/Next.js (1.3 months)
- **Back-end:** .NET, Node (1 year)
- **Data Science:** Python (7 months)

## Catch Me If You Can 🎥

When I'm not buried in code, you can find me:

- Watching **THEPRIMEAGEN** videos and trying to keep up with his blazingly-fast coding.
- Learning how to create my own **C++ game engine** because why not aim for the stars?
- Exploring new tech trends and wondering if my code will ever achieve sentience.

### Fun Facts About Me 🎉

- I speak fluent **C#** and **Python**, with a bit of **JavaScript** on the side.
- My idea of a good time is squashing bugs and writing clean, efficient code.
- I'm a big fan of **unit tests** – because who doesn't love knowing their code works perfectly?
- In my free time, I like to pretend I'm a wizard in **.NET** and conjure up magical applications.
